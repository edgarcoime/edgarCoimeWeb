    <p>My full name is Edgar Jaycinth Daclan Coime II, the prefix is officially included too. I know, I have a long name, and many of my friends often joke around about it. I also have a lot of nicknames such as E.J (Stands for my first and middle name) or even Egg (It’s a long story so maybe I’ll tell you in person) but I don’t prefer the food nickname though, Edgar is completely fine though whichever you prefer. I graduated Highschool in 2015 and took 2 years off to travel and take care of my mum. Afterward, I took an Electrical Foundations course in BCIT Burnaby campus thinking that would be the career path best suited for me. Turned out after finishing the course and working in the field that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would and so looked for other paths I could take.</p>
